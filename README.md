# Interactive-LEDs
Prototype using a teensy microcontroller

The leds will blink in a line when no interaction occurs (resting phase). When the button is pressed, 1 led will light up and blink. Each led has a unique blinking pattern that lasts for 10 seconds. The white led is the first to light up when the button is pressed, and the other leds will go off. Once the white led is finished with its unique blinking pattern, the system will continue to blink in a line (rest phase) until the button is pressed again. When the button is pressed for a second time, the next led will do its unique pattern and so on. The potentiometer is used to control brightness.
